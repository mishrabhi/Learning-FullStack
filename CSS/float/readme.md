# FLoat Property:

=> The float property specifies whether an element should float to the left, right, or not at all.

Note: Elements next to a floating element will flow around it. To avoid this, use the clear property.

1. none: The element does not float, (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default.

2. left: The element floats to the left of its container.

3. right: The element floats the right of its container.
