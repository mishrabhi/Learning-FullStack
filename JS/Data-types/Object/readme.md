> The Object type represents one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object().

> Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object.

### Deleting a property from an object:
* There isn't any method in an Object itself to delete its own properties.To do so, one must use the delete operator.


### There are two ways to access properties:
> Dot Notation

> Bracket Notation

Syntax:
```
object.propertyName
object[expression]
```
