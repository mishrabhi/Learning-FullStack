## 1. Assignment Operators:

* Assignment x = y
* Addition Assignment x+=y
* Substraction Assignment x-=y
* Multiplication Assignment x*=y
* Division Assignment x/=y
* Remainder Assignment x%=y

## 2. Comparision Operator:

* Equals ==  ( When using == in JS, we are comparing only values)
* Not Equals !=
* Strict Equals ===  ( When using triple equals === in JavaScript, we are testing for strict    equality. This means both the type and the value we are comparing have      to be the same)
* Strict Not Equal !==
* Greater than >
* Greater than or equal >=
* Less than or equal <=


## 3. Arithmetic Operators:

* Addition +
* Substraction -
* Multiplication *
* Division /
* Remainder %
* Increment ++
* Decrement --
* Unary negation -x(It also precedes the operand and converts non-numbers data types to numbers like unary plus, however, it performs an additional operation, negation)
* Unary Plus +x (This operator precedes the operand and tries to convert it to a number)


## 4. Logical Operator:

* Logical AND &&
* Logical OR ||
* Logical Not !

## 5. String Operator:
> Concatenation

## 6. Ternary Operator:
*  The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?)
> Condition ? val1 : val2

## 7. Comma Operator:
* A comma operator (,) mainly evaluates its operands from left to right sequentially and returns the value of the rightmost operand.

```
x = (2, 3);
console.log(x);
// output: 3
```

## 8. typeof
* used for type checking and returns the data type of the operand passed to it. 

## 9. instanceof
* tests to see if the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object. 

## Falsy Values:
* The empty string ''
* null
* undefined
* The number 0
* The number NaN
* The Boolean false
