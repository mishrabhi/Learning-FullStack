# Loops/Iteration

* Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

## For-loop:

* A *for* loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
* A for statement looks as follows:
```
for (initialization; condition;afterthought)
  statement
  ```

  ## Do-while:

  * The *do...while* statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

  * A *do...while* statement looks as follows:
  ```
  do
  statement
while (condition);
```

* In *do..while* loop, statement is always executed once before the condition is checked.

## While:

* A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. 
* A while statement looks as follows:
```
while (condition)
  statement
  ```

* If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
