## Math:

* Math is a built-in global object that provides a number of methods and properties for mathematical operations.

* The Math object's properties are constants, so you can't change their values. Their names are all
in uppercase to emphasize the difference between them and a normal property.


* If you only need an integer, you can use one of the following rounding methods:
> floor() to round down

> ceil() to round up

> round() to round to the nearest

## Date:

* Date() is a constructor function that creates date objects. You can create a new object by
passing:
> Nothing (defaults to today's date)

> A date-like string

> Separate values for day, month, time, and so on

> A timestamp

### Methods to work with date Objects:

* Once you've created a date object, there are lots of methods you can call on that object. Most of
the methods can be divided into set*() and get*() methods, for example, getMonth(), setMonth(), getHours(), setHours(), and so on.
