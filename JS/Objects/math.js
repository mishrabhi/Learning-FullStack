// Math is a little different from the other built-in global objects you have seen. It's not a function, and, therefore, cannot be used with new to create objects. Math is a built-in global object that provides a number of methods and properties for mathematical operations.

// The Math object's properties are constants, so you can't change their values. Their names are all in uppercase to emphasize the difference between them and a normal property.

// //The constant PI

console.log(Math.PI);   //3.141592653589793

// Square root of 2:
console.log(Math.SQRT2);  //1.4142135623730951

//Euler's constant:
console.log(Math.E);   //2.718281828459045

//Natural logarithm of 2:
console.log(Math.LN2);   //0.6931471805599453
